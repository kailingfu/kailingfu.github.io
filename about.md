I am a writer and performer based in Singapore. Drawing from my training in Butoh (with Yoshito Ohno), much of my work attends to the darkness and absurdity of everyday life. My recent work includes a couple of sketches for an indie comedy show, and a script about teenage depression (used for counselling training). 

I completed my MA in Performance Making at Goldsmiths, University of London, and BA in Theatre at the National University of Singapore. I was previously an in-house stage manager with a Mandarin theatre company in Singapore.
